        "\n",
        "#### **1. Biomarker Discovery**\n",
        "**Diagnostic markers:** Genes consistently different between cancer and normal tissue can serve as diagnostic biomarkers. For example, if certain genes are always overexpressed in cancer samples, they could be used in blood tests or tissue biopsies to detect cancer early.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prognostic indicators:** Expression patterns that predict patient outcomes help physicians make treatment decisions. Patients with high expression of certain oncogenes might need more aggressive treatment, while those with favorable signatures might do well with less intensive therapy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Predictive biomarkers:** Signatures that indicate drug response likelihood enable personalized medicine. Before prescribing a targeted therapy, doctors could test whether a patient's tumor has the molecular signature that predicts response to that specific drug.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. Drug Target Identification**\n",
        "**Oncogenes:** Genes overexpressed in cancer represent potential targets for inhibition. For example, kinase inhibitors can block overactive growth signals in cancer cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tumor suppressors:** Pathways that are suppressed in cancer could be restored through therapeutic intervention. For instance, drugs that reactivate p53 tumor suppressor function are being developed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Metabolic vulnerabilities:** Cancer-specific dependencies can be exploited therapeutically. If cancer cells become dependent on certain metabolic pathways, drugs targeting those pathways could selectively kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells.\n",
